# Spotify Backup

Simple application to save a Spotify users' list of liked songs and
playlists as an offline database. Rewrite of an older project written in
Python. Later goals include an (optional) ui, visualisation of the
database and automated backups to an online repository.

## Tasks

- Structure project according to industry norms.
- Good documentation and a user guide.
- Write unit tests.
- [x] Implement a robust commandline interface in the style of the Python argparse package.
- [ ] Create Spotify API wrapper.
- [ ] Design a sensible SQL database that minimises data duplication.
